(The 'size' column in the table above shows the number of annotated tokens in
a text. The number of tokens will be slightly larger than the number of words
in the original printed edition as some words have been split into multiple
tokens and some tokens have been inserted during annotation.)

Please see the XML files for detailed metadata and a full list of contributors.

Data formats
------------

The texts are available on two formats:

1. PROIEL XML: These files are the authoritative source files and the only ones
that contain all available annotation. They contain the complete morphological,
syntactic and information-structure annotation, as well as the complete text,
including punctuation, section headers etc. The schema is defined in
[`proiel.xsd`](https://github.com/proiel/proiel-treebank/blob/master/proiel.xsd).

2. [CoNLL-X format](http://nextens.uvt.nl/depparse-wiki/DataFormat)
